Definition (internal):

- The answer changes over time, but the timespan how often the answer must be updated
  would remain the same regardless of when the question is asked.

Task:
Generate EXACTLY 2 stationary temporal questions focusing on ONE event or process.

Rules:
- Must rely on real-world phenomena that change over time.
- Must be stable, cyclical, predictable, or rhythm-based.
- Must NOT paraphrase the examples.
- Must NOT use placeholders.
- Do NOT mention stationarity in the question.

Examples:
{examples}

Return JSON:
{
  "questions": ["q1","q2"]
}
\end{promptblock}

\subsection{Verification Prompt}
\label{sec:verification-prompt}
\begin{promptblock}
Can you please check for every single question in this dataset, if:
- the recency_label1 (and if available recency_label2) is correct for the question and context1 (if available context2)
- and if the questions makes sense in general (gramnatically)
Write the id into correct if correct, otherwise into incorrect.

\subsection{Labeling prompts}
\label{app:label-prompts}

\subsubsection{Stationary labeling}\label{prompt:label-stat}
\begin{promptblock}
Analyze this temporal question and produce temporal labels:

"{question}"

Your tasks (internal reasoning only, output JSON only):

1. Provide ONE recency label:
{
  "An-Hour": "changes within one hour",
  "A-Few-Hours": "changes within a few hours",
  "A-Day": "changes within one day",
  "A-Few-Days": "changes within a few days",
  "A-Week": "changes within one week",
  "A-Few-Weeks": "changes within a few weeks",
  "A-Month": "changes within one month",
  "A-Few-Months": "changes within a few months",
  "A-Year": "changes within one year",
  "A-Few-Years": "changes within a few years",
  "Many-Years": "changes after 10 or more years",
  "Never": "never changes"
}

2. Based on the selected label, write a short temporal context (ONE sentence) describing the current event, phase, or condition in which the question is asked. This does not have to be related to the question causally.
   - Must describe an EVENT, PHASE or CONDITION, taking place when the question becomes relevant.
   - No specific years.
   - No meta reasoning.
   - No "current"
   - No "the question is asked"

Return JSON:
{
  "recency_list": ["label1"],
  "context_list": ["context1"]
}
\end{promptblock}

\subsubsection{Non-stationary labeling}\label{prompt:label-nonstat}
\begin{promptblock}
Analyze this temporal question and produce temporal labels:

"{question}"

Your tasks (internal reasoning only, output JSON only):

1. Provide TWO recency labels (for two different realistic temporal situations), choose from:
{
  "An-Hour": "changes within one hour",
  "A-Few-Hours": "changes within a few hours",
  "A-Day": "changes within one day",
  "A-Few-Days": "changes within a few days",
  "A-Week": "changes within one week",
  "A-Few-Weeks": "changes within a few weeks",
  "A-Month": "changes within one month",
  "A-Few-Months": "changes within a few months",
  "A-Year": "changes within one year",
  "A-Few-Years": "changes within a few years",
  "Many-Years": "changes after 10 or more years",
  "Never": "never changes"
}

2. For each selected label provide ONE short temporal context (ONE sentence each) describing the current event, phase, or condition in which the question is asked. This does not have to be related to the question causally.
  - Each context must describe a different EVENT, PHASE or CONDITION, taking place when the question becomes relevant.
   - No specific years.
   - No meta reasoning.
   - No "current"
   - No "the question is asked"

Return JSON:
{
  "recency_list": ["label1", "label2"],
  "context_list": ["context1", "context2"]
}
